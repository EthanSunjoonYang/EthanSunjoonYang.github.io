            <p>Hello! My name is Ethan and I'm currently a first year at California Polytechnic State University in San Luis Obispo. 
                In my free time I enjoy listening to music, spending time with friends, taking pictures, editing videos, 
                and working on coding projects.</p>
            <p>I mostly code in Python with proficiency in HTML and CSS.</p>
